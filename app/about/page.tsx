        <p className="text-base lg:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-2">
          I'm a recent graduate of Epicodus' full-stack bootcamp, where I got hands-on experience with JavaScript, React, C#, ASP.NET, and building Web APIs. During my internship at Clarity Innovations, I tackled feature development and bug fixes for an EdTech dashboard, using React, JavaScript, and GitLab to streamline the user experience. My background in science, education, and creative roles gives me a unique perspective when solving problemsâ€”whether it's refactoring code or brainstorming new features.

          Outside of coding, you can find me hiking through the wilderness, foraging for mushrooms, or hitting the trails for some nordic skiing. I'm also fluent in Spanish and conversational in Italian, which comes in handy for building community and working with diverse teams. I'm excited to contribute my skills and enthusiasm to a mission-driven company where I can continue learning and growing alongside a collaborative team.
