        <p>I am a continuous learner, with a desire to connect to and understand that which is around me.</p>
        <br/>
          <p>Newly graduated from the final Epicodus cohort in Portland, I have a certificate in web and mobile development.
            It was a full-stack program with a focus on Javascript, React, C# and ASP.NET. I continue to learn and explore
            technology, having just finished my capstone project that included Python and a PostgreSQL database.</p>
          <p>Drawing on my background in Natural Resources Management and Culinary Arts, I offer a unique approach to
            problem-solving and a keen eye to detail.</p>
          <br/>
            <p>When I am not at the computer, I am likely in the forest: foraging for mushrooms, hiking to alpine lakes, or
              nordic skiing.</p>
